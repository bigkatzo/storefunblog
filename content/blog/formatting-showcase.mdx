# Heading Level 1

This is a comprehensive showcase of all the **advanced typography and formatting features** available in our blog platform. From syntax-highlighted code blocks to beautiful callouts, task lists, and more!

> **✨ New Features Added**
> 
> We've enhanced the blog with advanced typography features including syntax highlighting, beautiful styling, task lists, reading progress indicator, and much more!

## Heading Level 2

This heading has a subtle border underneath to create visual hierarchy and separate major sections.

### Heading Level 3

Perfect for subsections within your content.

#### Heading Level 4

Great for detailed breakdowns and nested topics.

##### Heading Level 5

Smaller but still bold and clear.

###### Heading Level 6

The smallest heading, styled with uppercase letters for distinction.

## Text Formatting

Here's how different text styles look:

This is **bold text** for emphasis. This is *italic text* for subtle emphasis. You can also combine them: ***bold and italic text***.

Here's some ~~strikethrough text~~ for showing corrections or removed content.

You can also use `inline code` for technical terms or code snippets within sentences.

---

## Lists

### Unordered Lists (Bullet Points)

Here's a simple bullet list:

- First item in the list
- Second item with more content
- Third item
  - Nested item level 1
  - Another nested item
    - Even deeper nesting
- Back to top level

### Ordered Lists (Numbered)

Here's a numbered list:

1. First step in the process
2. Second step with detailed instructions
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
4. Final step

### Mixed Lists

You can even mix them:

1. First numbered item
   - Bullet point under number
   - Another bullet point
2. Second numbered item
   - More bullet points
     1. Numbered under bullet
     2. Another numbered item

## Quotes

> This is a blockquote. It's perfect for highlighting important information, customer testimonials, or notable quotes. The left border and background make it stand out beautifully from the rest of the content.

> You can also have multiple paragraphs in quotes.
>
> Like this second paragraph here.

---

## Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

Inline code looks like this: `const hello = "world"` with beautiful styling.

> **💡 Copy Code Feature**
> 
> Hover over any code block to see a copy button appear in the top-right corner!

### JavaScript / TypeScript

```javascript
function calculateDiscount(price, percentage) {
  const discount = price * (percentage / 100);
  const finalPrice = price - discount;
  
  console.log(`Original: $${price}`);
  console.log(`Discount: ${percentage}%`);
  console.log(`Final Price: $${finalPrice}`);
  
  return finalPrice;
}

// Example usage
const salePrice = calculateDiscount(99.99, 25);
```

### Python

```python
def calculate_total(items):
    """
    Calculate the total price of items with tax.
    
    Args:
        items (list): List of item dictionaries
    
    Returns:
        float: Total price including tax
    """
    subtotal = sum(item['price'] for item in items)
    tax = subtotal * 0.08
    total = subtotal + tax
    
    return round(total, 2)

# Example usage
items = [
    {'name': 'Product 1', 'price': 29.99},
    {'name': 'Product 2', 'price': 49.99}
]
print(f"Total: ${calculate_total(items)}")
```

### React / JSX

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
  
  const handleAddToCart = () => {
    console.log(`Adding ${quantity} ${product.name} to cart`);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="product-card">
      <img src={product.image} alt={product.name} />
      <h3>{product.name}</h3>
      <p>${product.price}</p>
      <input 
        type="number" 
        value={quantity}
        onChange={(e) => setQuantity(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>
        Add to Cart
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### CSS / SCSS
