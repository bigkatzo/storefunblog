# Heading Level 1

This is a comprehensive showcase of all the beautiful text formatting options available in our blog platform. Let's explore every element!

## Heading Level 2

This heading has a subtle border underneath to create visual hierarchy and separate major sections.

### Heading Level 3

Perfect for subsections within your content.

#### Heading Level 4

Great for detailed breakdowns and nested topics.

##### Heading Level 5

Smaller but still bold and clear.

###### Heading Level 6

The smallest heading, styled with uppercase letters for distinction.

## Text Formatting

Here's how different text styles look:

This is **bold text** for emphasis. This is *italic text* for subtle emphasis. You can also combine them: ***bold and italic text***.

Here's some ~~strikethrough text~~ for showing corrections or removed content.

You can also use `inline code` for technical terms or code snippets within sentences.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists (Bullet Points)

Here's a simple bullet list:

- First item in the list
- Second item with more content
- Third item
  - Nested item level 1
  - Another nested item
    - Even deeper nesting
- Back to top level

### Ordered Lists (Numbered)

Here's a numbered list:

1. First step in the process
2. Second step with detailed instructions
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
4. Final step

### Mixed Lists

You can even mix them:

1. First numbered item
   - Bullet point under number
   - Another bullet point
2. Second numbered item
   - More bullet points
     1. Numbered under bullet
     2. Another numbered item

## Quotes

> This is a blockquote. It's perfect for highlighting important information, customer testimonials, or notable quotes. The left border and background make it stand out beautifully from the rest of the content.

> You can also have multiple paragraphs in quotes.
>
> Like this second paragraph here.

## Code Blocks

Inline code looks like this: `const hello = "world"`.

Here's a full code block with syntax:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return true;
}

greet('Store.fun');
```

```python
def calculate_total(items):
    """Calculate the total price of items."""
    total = sum(item['price'] for item in items)
    return total

# Example usage
items = [{'name': 'Product 1', 'price': 29.99}]
print(calculate_total(items))
```

## Links

Here's a [link to Store.fun](https://store.fun) that's beautifully styled with an underline that animates on hover.

You can also use [multiple links](https://store.fun/blog) in [the same paragraph](https://store.fun/features).
