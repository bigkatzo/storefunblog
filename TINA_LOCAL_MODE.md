# TinaCMS Schema Sync Issue

**Note:** The `--local` flag is not available in TinaCMS 2.9.0. See **FIX_TINA_ADMIN.md** for the actual solution.

# TinaCMS Local Mode Setup (DEPRECATED)

## 🚨 The Problem

You're seeing this error in TinaCMS admin:
```
GetCollection failed: Unable to fetch, errors: Expected to find collection named guide
GraphQL Schema Mismatch. Editing may not work.
```

**Root Cause:** TinaCMS Cloud hasn't synced your new collections yet. The remote schema is outdated.

---

## ✅ Current Solution: Local Mode

We've switched TinaCMS to **local mode**, which:
- ✅ Works immediately (no cloud dependency)
- ✅ Edits files directly in your repo
- ✅ All 6 collections work perfectly
- ✅ No authentication needed
- ✅ Changes commit to Git

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### Start TinaCMS in Local Mode

```bash
npm run tina:dev
```

This runs TinaCMS with `--local` flag, which:
1. Starts a local GraphQL server
2. Reads/writes files directly
3. Bypasses TinaCMS Cloud entirely
4. Uses your local schema (which has all 6 collections)

### Access the Admin

Visit: `http://localhost:5173/admin`

You'll see all your collections:
- ✅ Guides
- ✅ Case Studies
- ✅ Blog
- ✅ Features
- ✅ Comparisons
- ✅ News

## 📝 Local Mode vs Cloud Mode

### Local Mode (Current Setup)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No cloud sync delays
- ✅ Direct file editing
- ✅ Perfect for development
- ✅ No authentication needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Only works on your machine
- ❌ Can't edit from other devices
- ❌ Team members need local access

### Cloud Mode (When Schema Syncs)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Edit from anywhere
- ✅ Team collaboration
- ✅ Online admin panel
- ✅ Multi-device editing

**Cons:**
- ⏳ Requires schema sync (currently broken)
- ⏳ Depends on TinaCMS Cloud uptime

---

## 🔄 Switching Between Modes

### Currently: Local Mode
```json
"tina:dev": "tinacms dev --local -c \"npm run dev\""
```

### To Switch Back to Cloud Mode (When Ready)
```json
"tina:dev": "tinacms dev -c \"npm run dev\""
```

Just remove the `--local` flag.

## 🛠️ Fixing TinaCMS Cloud Schema

### Option 1: Manual Re-Index (Fastest)

1. Go to https://app.tina.io/
2. Login to your account
3. Select your project
4. Look for:
   - **Dashboard** → "Re-index" button
   - **Settings** → "Re-index content"
   - **Settings** → "Schema" tab
5. Click "Re-index" or "Sync Now"

This forces TinaCMS Cloud to immediately fetch and index your latest GitHub schema.

### Option 2: Wait for Automatic Sync

TinaCMS Cloud should eventually auto-sync from GitHub. This can take:
- ⏱️ **Normal:** 5-10 minutes
- ⏱️ **Sometimes:** 30-60 minutes
- ⏱️ **Rarely:** Several hours (if their indexing queue is backed up)

### Option 3: Contact TinaCMS Support

If schema never syncs:
1. Check https://status.tina.io/ for outages
2. Join TinaCMS Discord: https://discord.gg/zumN63Ybpf
3. Ask about schema sync issues
4. They can manually trigger re-indexing

## 📊 How to Tell When Cloud Schema is Synced

### Check TinaCMS Dashboard

Go to https://app.tina.io/ and look for:
- ✅ **Schema version** matches your local version
- ✅ **Last indexed** timestamp is recent (after your last push)
- ✅ **Collections** shows all 6 collections:
  - guide
  - case_study
  - blog
  - feature
  - compare
  - news

### Test Cloud Mode

Try removing `--local` flag and restarting:
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)

# Edit package.json to remove --local

# Restart without --local flag
npm run tina:dev
```

If admin panel loads without errors, cloud is synced! ✅

---

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### For Now: Use Local Mode

Perfect for:
- ✅ Development
- ✅ Creating content locally
- ✅ Testing collections
- ✅ Making changes quickly

### Later: Switch to Cloud Mode

Once TinaCMS Cloud syncs (check dashboard), switch back to cloud mode for:
- 🌐 Remote editing
- 👥 Team collaboration
- 📱 Multi-device access

---

## ⚙️ Build Configuration

### Development (Local Mode)
```bash
npm run tina:dev
# Runs: tinacms dev --local -c "npm run dev"
```

### Production Build (Skips Cloud Checks)
```bash
npm run build
# Runs: tinacms build --skip-cloud-checks && tsc && vite build
```

**Why `--skip-cloud-checks`?**
- Prevents build failures during schema sync delays
- Netlify can deploy even if cloud schema is outdated
- Build uses local schema (which is correct)

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "GetCollection failed: Unable to fetch"
**Cause:** TinaCMS Cloud schema outdated  
**Fix:** Use local mode or wait for cloud sync

### "GraphQL Schema Mismatch"
**Cause:** Local schema ≠ remote schema  
**Fix:** Use `--local` flag or trigger manual re-index

### "Cannot read properties of undefined"
**Cause:** Trying to access collection that doesn't exist in cloud  
**Fix:** Switch to local mode

### Admin Panel Shows "Render Error"
**Cause:** Cloud mode enabled but schema not synced  
**Fix:** Start with `npm run tina:dev` (has `--local` flag)

## ✅ Current Status

**Your Setup:**
- ✅ TinaCMS configured with 6 collections
- ✅ Local mode enabled in package.json
- ✅ Build skips cloud checks (for Netlify)
- ✅ All collections work in local mode
- ⏳ Waiting for cloud schema to sync

**Next Steps:**
