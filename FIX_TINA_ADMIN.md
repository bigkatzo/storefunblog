# üîß Fix TinaCMS Admin Panel

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

When you access `http://localhost:5173/admin`, you see:
```
GetCollection failed: Unable to fetch, errors: Expected to find collection named guide
GraphQL Schema Mismatch
```

## ‚úÖ THE FIX (Takes 2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to TinaCMS Dashboard
1. Open: **https://app.tina.io/**
2. Login with your credentials
3. Select your **storefunblog** project

### Step 2: Trigger Manual Re-Index
Look for one of these buttons:
- **"Re-index"** button (usually in dashboard)
- **Settings** ‚Üí **"Re-index Content"**
- **Settings** ‚Üí **"Sync Schema"**
- **Content** ‚Üí **"Force Refresh"**

Click it! This forces TinaCMS Cloud to:
1. ‚úÖ Fetch your latest GitHub code
2. ‚úÖ Read your new schema with 6 collections
3. ‚úÖ Update the remote GraphQL API
4. ‚úÖ Make admin panel work

### Step 3: Wait 2-5 Minutes
The re-indexing process typically takes 2-5 minutes.

### Step 4: Refresh Admin Panel
Go back to `http://localhost:5173/admin` and refresh.

**You should now see all 6 collections:**
- ‚úÖ Guides
- ‚úÖ Case Studies
- ‚úÖ Blog
- ‚úÖ Features
- ‚úÖ Comparisons
- ‚úÖ News

## üéØ Alternative: Edit Files Directly (Works Now)

```

**Add content:**
```markdown
---

## üö® If Re-Index Button Doesn't Exist

Some TinaCMS dashboard versions don't have an obvious re-index button. Try:

### Option 1: Check Project Settings
1. Go to your project
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Look through tabs for:
   - "Schema" tab
   - "Content" tab
   - "Advanced" tab
4. Look for "Re-index", "Sync", or "Refresh" button

### Option 2: Make a Dummy Commit
Sometimes pushing a new commit triggers re-indexing:

```bash
# Add a space to README
echo " " >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger TinaCMS re-index"
git push origin main
```

Then wait 5-10 minutes for automatic sync.

### Option 3: Contact TinaCMS Support
If nothing works:
1. Join TinaCMS Discord: https://discord.gg/zumN63Ybpf
2. Post in #support channel:
   ```
   Hi! My TinaCMS Cloud schema won't sync after pushing new collections to GitHub.
   Project: storefunblog
   Branch: main
   Last push: [your timestamp]
   Error: "Expected to find collection named guide"
   ```

They can manually trigger re-indexing from their end.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Why Is This Happening?

### What You Changed
You added 6 new collections:
- guide (replaces tutorial)
- case_study
- blog (replaces post)  
- feature
- compare
- news

### What TinaCMS Cloud Needs
TinaCMS Cloud needs to:
1. Detect your GitHub push ‚úÖ (Done)
2. Clone your repo
3. Read your schema
4. Update remote GraphQL API ‚è≥ (Stuck here)
5. Re-index content

### Why It's Stuck
TinaCMS Cloud's auto-sync is delayed. Manual re-index forces it to happen immediately.

## ‚úÖ Production Builds (Already Fixed)

Your Netlify builds work because we added `--skip-cloud-checks`:
```json
"build": "tinacms build --skip-cloud-checks && tsc && vite build"
```

This bypasses the schema check, so your site deploys successfully even while admin panel is broken.

**Problem:** TinaCMS Cloud schema outdated  
**Quick Fix:** Manual re-index at https://app.tina.io/  
**Time:** 2-5 minutes after clicking re-index
