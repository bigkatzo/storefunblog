   - Click "Add a variable"
   - Add each of the three variables above

2. **Trigger a Redeploy:**

   - Or manually trigger a deploy in Netlify dashboard

3. **Verify:**
   - Visit: https://storefunblog.netlify.app/
   - Visit admin: https://storefunblog.netlify.app/admin

## Local Development

For local development, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run tina:dev
```

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ All tokens are now in environment variables
- ‚úÖ `.env` is in `.gitignore` (not committed to Git)
- ‚úÖ Production tokens are only in Netlify, not in code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The `VITE_TINA_CLIENT_ID` is exposed in the browser (this is normal and safe)
- üîí `TINA_TOKEN` and `TINA_SEARCH_TOKEN` are only used during build time
