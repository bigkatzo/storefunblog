# Frontend Routing Fix - Articles Now Showing!

## üéâ Problem Solved!

Your articles weren't showing because the frontend was only configured to load from `content/posts/` and route `/blog/:slug`, but you have 6 different collections in different folders.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Content Loader Updated**
**File:** `src/lib/mdx-loader.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
const postFiles = import.meta.glob('../../content/posts/*.mdx')
```

**After:**
```typescript
const postFiles = import.meta.glob('../../content/**/*.mdx')
```

Now loads from **ALL collections**: guides, case-studies, blog, features, compare, news

### 2. **Slug Generation Fixed**
Slugs now include the collection path:
- `guides/my-guide`
- `compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce`
- `blog/my-post`

### 3. **Routes Added**
**File:** `src/App.tsx`

Added routes for all 6 collections:
```typescript
<Route path="/guides/:slug" element={<BlogPost />} />
<Route path="/case-studies/:slug" element={<BlogPost />} />
<Route path="/blog/:slug" element={<BlogPost />} />
<Route path="/features/:slug" element={<BlogPost />} />
<Route path="/compare/:slug" element={<BlogPost />} />
<Route path="/news/:slug" element={<BlogPost />} />
```

### 4. **BlogPost Component Updated**
**File:** `src/pages/BlogPost.tsx`

Now extracts collection from URL path to match the correct content.

### 5. **BlogCard Links Fixed**
**File:** `src/components/BlogCard.tsx`

Links now use full slug path: `/${slug}` instead of `/blog/${slug}`

## üåê Correct URL Structure

Your articles are now accessible at these URLs:

### Guides
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/guides/your-guide-name
```

### Case Studies
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/case-studies/your-case-study
```

### Blog
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/blog/your-blog-post
```

### Features
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/features/your-feature
```

### Comparisons
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/compare/product-a-vs-product-b
```

### News
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/news/your-news-article
```

## ‚ùå Wrong URL Format

You were trying:
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/content/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce
                                   ^^^^^^^^ This part should NOT be here!
```

**Why it was wrong:** The `/content/` folder is just for file storage. It's not part of the URL path.

---

## ‚úÖ Correct URL Format

```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce
```

**Collection ‚Üí URL mapping:**
- Folder: `content/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce.mdx`
- URL: `/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce`

---

## üîç How It Works Now

### 1. Content Creation in TinaCMS
When you create content in TinaCMS admin:

**Example: Create a comparison**
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Select "Comparisons" collection
3. Create post: "Shopify vs WooCommerce"
4. TinaCMS saves to: `content/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce.mdx`

### 2. Frontend Loading
The frontend automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Scans all `content/**/*.mdx` files
2. ‚úÖ Extracts collection and filename
3. ‚úÖ Creates slug: `compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce`
4. ‚úÖ Makes it available at: `/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce`

### 3. Routing
React Router matches the URL:
1. User visits: `/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce`
2. Route matches: `/compare/:slug`
3. BlogPost component loads content with slug: `compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce`
4. ‚úÖ Article displays!

## üìä URL Examples for Your Content

Based on your example comparison file:

**File:** `content/compare/example-comparison.mdx`
**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
title: Shopify vs WooCommerce - Complete Comparison
slug: shopify-vs-woocommerce
```

**Live URLs:**
```
Local:      http://localhost:5173/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce
Production: https://storefunblog.netlify.app/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce
```

## üîÑ After Netlify Rebuild

Once Netlify rebuilds your site (should take 2-3 minutes), all these URLs will work:

### Your Example Files:
- ‚úÖ `/guides/example-guide`
- ‚úÖ `/case-studies/example-case-study`
- ‚úÖ `/blog/example-blog-post`
- ‚úÖ `/features/example-feature`
- ‚úÖ `/compare/example-comparison`
- ‚úÖ `/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce` (your comparison)

### Your Old Posts:
- ‚úÖ `/posts/getting-started-react-typescript`
- ‚úÖ `/posts/framer-motion-animations`
- ‚úÖ `/posts/mastering-tailwind-css`

---

## üè† Homepage

The homepage at `/` will show all articles from all collections mixed together, sorted by date.

**This includes:**
- All guides
- All case studies
- All blog posts
- All features
- All comparisons
- All news articles

---

## üéØ Testing Your Fix

### Once Netlify Rebuilds:

**1. Test the comparison URL:**
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/compare/example-comparison
```

**2. Test other collections:**
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/guides/example-guide
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/features/example-feature
```

**3. Homepage should show all content:**
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/
```

## üìù Creating New Content

### In TinaCMS Admin:
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/admin` or `https://storefunblog.netlify.app/admin`
2. Select a collection
3. Click "Create New"
4. Fill in fields (especially `title`)
5. Click "Save"
6. ‚úÖ Auto-commits to GitHub
7. ‚úÖ Netlify auto-deploys
8. ‚úÖ Article appears at `/{collection}/{slug}`

### URLs Are Auto-Generated:
The slug is based on the `title` field (converted to URL-friendly format):
- Title: "My Awesome Guide"
- Slug: `my-awesome-guide`
- URL: `/guides/my-awesome-guide`

## üöÄ Summary

**Problem:** Articles not showing (wrong URL structure)  
**Cause:** Frontend only loaded from `content/posts/` and routed `/blog/:slug`  
**Solution:** Updated to load from all collections and route all paths  
**Result:** All collections now work with correct URLs! ‚úÖ

**Your comparison article will be at:**
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce
```

**NOT at:**
```
https://storefunblog.netlify.app/content/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce
                                   ‚ùå Remove /content/
```

Wait for Netlify to finish rebuilding (check your Netlify dashboard), then your articles will show! üéâ
